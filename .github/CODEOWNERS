# This repo is multi-tenanted
# To enable teams to be self service they are allowed to merge changes related to their own applications

# The rules are simple:
#Â 1. only AAT and prod are protected
# 2. Prod requires a review from the @hmcts/production-apps-approvals team
# 3. AAT requires a review from @hmcts/platform-engineering or @hmcts/devops
# 4. only file name entries may be added to CODEOWNERS, no directories as that bypasses the review for new applications
# 5. be sensible, every change is tracked through git, don't repurpose files, create a new one for new applications

# To add a new app:
# Raise a pull request adding it to k8s/<env>/common/<product>/<component>.yaml
# If you're adding the application to AAT or prod then then add a line referring to it below, i.e. 
# k8s/aat/common/cmc/claim-store.yaml @hmcts/cmc
# k8s/prod/common/cmc/claim-store.yaml @hmcts/cmc
